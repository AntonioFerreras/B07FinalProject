This is the final project for CSCB07. We made an app for people to purchase groceries. It uses FireBase with Android Studio.

## How to use:

# As a store owner:
- Click on MY STORE and create your store
- You can add, edit, and delete products
- You can view your current orders from customers, and mark them as complete when they are ready for pickup
- You can also view previous orders

# As a customer:
- Click on SHOP for a list of stores
- Click on a store and add the products you want to your cart
- Go to MY CART and you can view your draft orders. You can have one order per store at a time.
- You can click on the draft order to edit it, to edit the quantity of an item, select the number input and input a new number, then press enter.
- You can delete an order by setting the quantity to 0
- You can send the order to the store by clicking the send button
- You can see in progress and orders that are ready for pickup/completed

You can also go to your account page (right nav button) and see your account details and edit your name, change password, and sign out.
